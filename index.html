        <p class="lead mb-4"> Culture shapes everyone. It influences everything from our beliefs to our daily behavior. 
If you grew up in a culturally dominant country/ region it’s hard to notice how much of your life 
is influenced by it. Only if you moved away from “home” you start to see how much of the 
culture was in that place and how much of it is in you. I was born and raised in Georgia 
(Republic of). I was constantly surrounded by Georgian culture and other Caucasian cultures. 
The Caucasus is one of the most ethnically diverse regions. When my family moved to the 
United States all of it suddenly disappeared. No more random visits from family, no more family 
celebrations, no more fireworks on New Year's Eve, no more wake up to your neighbors fighting, 
no more smell of Georgian bread from the bakery at the corner of the street. Every little thing 
that made up my daily life was gone. 
As an immigrant, it is hard to keep the traditions, especially when you are surrounded by 
people who do not share the same culture as you. The holidays in the United States are somewhat 
different from Georgian holidays. Despite both of the countries being predominantly Christian, 
Georgians are Eastern Orthodox, which means we use a different calendar for holidays. 
Georgians celebrate Christmas on January 7th. The celebration itself is also different, we do not 
exchange gifts. Instead, the gifts are exchanged on New Year’s Eve at midnight. The unity during 
these holidays is what makes them so special to me. <br><br>

        I moved to California at the age of 19.  We have a saying in Georgian: 
“ძალა ერთობაშია” which translates to “Power is in Unity”, I think it perfectly represents my 
culture. In health and hardships, everyone is there for each other. The feeling of unity and 
willingness to help, which are always present in Georgian culture, has shaped me into the person I am today. It is expected of me to always help out people in need, whether it’s my family, 
friends, or a stranger. It also relates to a cultural value, fundamental beliefs about what is 
important, what makes a good life, and what is true, right, and beautiful (Norton 39), that if you 
do good, it will come back to you. My parents made sure that we live by these values and treat 
other people with respect and kindness. 
Despite having culture as with important values there are some that a woman makes me 
feel disempowered. Most Georgians believe that woman’s only “job” should be raising children 
and being a housewife. Because this woman’s every decision from career choice to what they 
wear is faced by a lot of criticism and unnecessary judgment. Aside from misogyny, Georgian 
culture can also be ethnocentric. Even though Georgia is surrounded by different cultures the 
belief that Georgians are “superior” is widely spread in the country. For the most part, it is 
expressed through patriotism but in some radical cases, it can be expressed through racism, 
xenophobia, and discrimination. <br><br>
